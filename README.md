# students-hostel-allocation

This is a Restful API project built with NestJS.
It enables students to register with certain parameters such as full names, passwords e.t.c, and to choose hostel of their choice to lodge for that academic year.

Accommodations are assigned in order.
PostgreSQL is the database used for the project, and the ORM is Prisma.
